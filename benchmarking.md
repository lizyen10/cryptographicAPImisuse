# Benchmarkiing

### Key Metrics for Benchmarking
1.	Detection Accuracy
    - True Positives (TP) → Correctly detected vulnerabilities.
    - False Positives (FP) → Incorrectly flagged issues.
    - False Negatives (FN) → Missed real vulnerabilities.
    - Precision & Recall → Measures how well the tool balances correct detection and minimizing errors.
2.	Performance
    - Execution time → How fast does the tool analyze the code?
    - Scalability → Can the tool handle large codebases efficiently?
3.	Coverage
    - What types of vulnerabilities does the tool detect?
    - How well does it handle complex scenarios (e.g., insecure cryptographic API use, SQL injection, XSS)?
4.	Ease of Use
    - Installation complexity.
    - Configuration requirements.
    - Integration with CI/CD pipelines.

### Benchmarking Process
1.	Define Evaluation Criteria
    - Focus on cryptographic API misuse, insecure hashing, hardcoded keys, etc.
2.	Create a Test Suite
    - A set of small code snippets with correct and incorrect usage.
    - Use test cases with weak cryptographic practices (e.g., MD5, hardcoded keys).
3.	Run Static Analysis Tools
    - Execute Bandit, Semgrep, CodeQL, etc., on the test cases.
    - Compare Bandit, Semgrep, and CodeQL on how well they detect these issues.
4.	Collect & Analyze Results
    - Measure detection accuracy and compare results.
5.	Generate Reports
    - Visualize findings with tables or graphs.

# Building a benchmarking tool

To build a benchmarking tool for evaluating static code analysis tools in detecting cryptographic API misuse, follow these steps:

1. Define Benchmarking Criteria
    - Identify common cryptographic API misuses (e.g., hardcoded keys, weak ciphers, ECB mode, insecure PRNGs).
    - Determine which static analysis tools you want to evaluate (e.g., Bandit, Semgrep, CodeQL).
    - Define evaluation metrics: detection accuracy, false positives/negatives, execution time, and coverage.
2. Prepare Test Cases
    - Create a dataset of small code snippets containing correct and incorrect uses of cryptographic APIs.
    - Include both simple and complex misuse patterns.
    - Ensure a diverse set of test cases covering different cryptographic libraries (e.g., pycryptodome, cryptography).
3. Automate Static Analysis Execution
    - Write a Python script to run each selected static analysis tool on the test cases.
    - Parse and collect results from tool outputs.
    - Store results in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
4. Evaluate and Compare Results
    - Analyze which tools detected the most misuses correctly.
    - Set up a scoring system 
    - Compare false positives and false negatives.
    - Generate reports or visualizations to summarize findings.
5. Extend and Improve
    - Add more test cases to increase robustness.
    - Automate benchmarking for new versions of static analysis tools.
    - Provide recommendations based on findings.
