False Negative - Rule1/HasVuln/testfile210.py:
NO, there is no cryptographic API misuse detected in this code snippet, as it does not utilize any cryptographic APIs; however, the use of `verify=False` in the HTTPS request is a security risk as it disables SSL certificate verification, potentially exposing the application to man-in-the-middle attacks.

True Positive - Rule1/HasVuln/testfile225.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse, because the `requests` library is used to make an HTTPS request with SSL certificate verification disabled (`verify=False`), which exposes the request to man-in-the-middle attacks and undermines the security of the cryptographic protocol.

True Positive - Rule1/HasVuln/testfile233.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the `verify` parameter in the `requests.request` method is set to `False`, which disables SSL certificate verification, exposing the application to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the code disables SSL certificate verification by setting `verify=False`, which exposes the application to man-in-the-middle attacks and undermines the security of the HTTPS connection.

- detects the verify=false correctly in the last 3 files as crypto api misuse, but in the first it detects it, but does not classify it as a crypto api misuse



True Positive - Rule2/HasVuln/testfile208.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse, as the code sets the `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable to an empty string, which disables SSL certificate verification for the HTTPS request made to `https://google.com`, potentially exposing the application to man-in-the-middle attacks.

True Positive - Rule2/HasVuln/testfile223.py:

False Negative - Rule5/HasVuln/testfile232.py:
NO, there is no cryptographic API misuse detected in the code snippet, as it does not utilize any cryptographic functions or APIs; instead, it simply employs the `random` module to generate a random integer, which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes but does not constitute misuse of a cryptographic API.

False Negative - Rule5/HasVuln/testfile242.py:
NO, there is no cryptographic API misuse detected in this code snippet because it does not utilize any cryptographic functions or APIs; instead, it simply generates a random integer using Python's built-in `random` module, which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes but does not constitute misuse in this context.

False Negative - Rule5/HasVuln/testfile254.py:
NO, there is no cryptographic API misuse detected because the code simply uses the `random` module to generate a random integer, which is not intended for cryptographic purposes.

- detects the use of random correctly once, but in the first two and last it acknowledges that random is not safe for cryptographgic purposes, but does not classify it as crypto api misuse, likely bc it is not being used in a crypto context 
- detects it correctly once though, even though it is not being used in a crypto context 

True Positive - Rule6/HasVuln/testfile196.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the code uses the `pbkdf2_hmac` function with a fixed salt (`b'D8VxSmTZt2E2YV454mkqAY5e'`), which undermines the security of the hashing process by making it vulnerable to precomputation attacks.

True Positive - Rule6/HasVuln/testfile203.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the password used in the `pbkdf2_hmac` function exceeds the recommended length for secure password hashing, and the salt (the `argument` parameter) is not securely generated or managed, which can lead to vulnerabilities in the hashing process.

False Negative - Rule6/HasVuln/testfile216.py:
NO, there is no cryptographic API misuse detected in the provided code snippet, as it correctly uses the `pbkdf2_hmac` function for password hashing with a secure hashing algorithm (`sha256`) and an appropriate iteration count (100,000).

True Positive - Rule6/HasVuln/testfile220.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the password used in the `pbkdf2_hmac` function exceeds the expected length for secure hashing, which could lead to performance issues and is not a recommended practice for password hashing.

- correctly detetced a crypto api misuse 3 out of 4 times, but, the reasoning is a bit off
- twice they talk about the insecurely generated static salt, but also that the password exceeds the length for secure hashing?
- the FN one is just wrong, doesnt detect the insecure salt at all

True Positive - Rule8/HasVuln/testfile201.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse, because the code uses a randomly generated salt (`os.urandom(45)`) each time the `starting_method` is called, which prevents the consistent hashing of the same password and makes it impossible to verify the password later.

True Positive - Rule8/HasVuln/testfile217.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the code uses `os.urandom(45)` to generate a salt that is too short; a salt should ideally be at least 16 bytes long for better security against rainbow table attacks.

True Positive - Rule8/HasVuln/testfile221.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the `os.urandom(45)` function is being used to generate a random salt for the password hashing without ensuring that the salt is securely stored or reused, which is critical for the security of the hashed password.



True Positive - Rule9/HasVuln/testfile187.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the `cipher.encrypt()` method is called with a plaintext message and then immediately decrypted with the same cipher instance, which can lead to confusion and potential security vulnerabilities, particularly since the IV is prepended to the ciphertext without proper handling.

True Positive - Rule9/HasVuln/testfile204.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the code uses a hardcoded key, which is insecure, and it also improperly handles the initialization vector (IV) by including it in the encrypted message without proper validation or handling, potentially exposing it to replay attacks.

True Positive - Rule9/HasVuln/testfile211.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse, because the code incorrectly uses the same initialization vector (IV) for both encryption and decryption, which can lead to security vulnerabilities as IVs should be unique and random for each encryption operation to ensure the confidentiality of the data.

False Negative - Rule9/HasVuln/testfile226.py:
NO. The code snippet correctly uses the AES encryption algorithm in CFB mode with a randomly generated initialization vector (IV), which is appropriate for secure encryption practices.

True Positive - Rule12/HasVuln/testfile256.py:
YES, there is cryptographic API misuse because the code uses the `jwt.decode` function with `verify_signature` set to `False`, which undermines the security of the JWT decoding process by not verifying the token's signature.
